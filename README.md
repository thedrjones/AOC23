# AOC23
(Advent of Code 2023)[https://adventofcode.com/2023], in InterSystems ObjectScript (but generally compatible with standard MUMPS, if you add some extra functions).

I won't always do it on the day it was set for, some days I may skip because I get annoyed, or get distracted by real life!

I use the InterSystems IRIS Community Edition (2023.3), deployed via [Docker](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=AFL_containers), with a [durable](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=ADOCK#ADOCK_iris_durable_running) database directory.
